-Concluded teams outside of HLTV's top 30 were not worthy enough to use
-Teams that were Top 10 in HLTV's rankings generally always won the S-Tier tournaments
-Only players in the top 30 teams have player ratings that are legitimate enough to use

-I concluded that Headshot percentage was the best stat to look at. I concluded HLTV's player rankings did not explain Astralis' success over the years, and only their extreme good headshot percentage average was evidence to their success. It would explain why Yekindar was so good in the Intel Extreme Masters, because he had an insanely high headshot percentage number.

-Another important stat to look at was clutches, but the stat isn't as readily available like headshot percengage, kd ratio, etc. Stats are available on hltv

-Match results in the last ten games was a good indicator of success too. The stat is available on liquidpedia
